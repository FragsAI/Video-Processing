# Video-Processing

The goal of this project is to develop a video segmentation tool that can take a long video as input and generate smaller clips based on specified filters or criteria. The tool should leverage computer vision and audio analysis techniques to identify relevant segments within the video.

## Task Overview

You are tasked with designing and implementing a video segmentation pipeline that includes the following components:

1.  **Video Processing**:
   - Integrate a video processing library (e.g., OpenCV, FFmpeg) to handle video decoding, frame extraction, and other video manipulation tasks.
   - Implement functionality to read input video streams, extract individual frames, and prepare data for further analysis.

2. **Shot Boundary Detection**:
   - Develop algorithms or techniques to detect transitions between shots or scenes in the video, such as comparing histogram differences or edge changes between consecutive frames.
   - Implement shot boundary detection to identify potential points in the video where a new clip could begin or end.

## Requirements

- Proficiency in Python programming language and familiarity with computer vision and machine learning libraries (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
- Experience with video processing techniques and libraries.
- Knowledge of object detection, scene recognition, and other relevant computer vision tasks.

## Deliverables

1. A well-documented and modular codebase for the video segmentation tool.

## Resources

- OpenCV documentation: https://docs.opencv.org/
- TensorFlow Object Detection API: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection
- PyTorch documentation: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html

Please note that this is a challenging task, and you may need to research and explore additional resources and techniques to accomplish the desired functionality. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification.
